Hi, it's Abdullah. I am a software engineer from Turkey :tr:. I'm mainly focused on Rust, async programming and distributed systems right now. I like solving and thinking about challenging stuff, doing optimization and sharing my knowledge. Purpose of this website is to improve myself by sharing my knowledge and help others to improve themselves. Please feel free to contact me :).
