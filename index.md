Hi, it's Abdullah. I am software engineer from Turkey :tr:. I am interested in Rust programming, operating systems, virtualization and distributed systems. In general, I am interested in how things work internally, and how to make them even better. Doing optimization, dealing with complex systems and problems, working close to hardware and sharing my knowledge are the things that I like. I want to share my learning experience as well as some informative material in this blog. Please feel free to contact :).
