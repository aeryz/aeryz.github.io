<p>I love to learn how things really work and build things from scratch. Since I am interested in virtualization, operating systems and work as an embedded software engineer, I wanted to give this a go. Here are some good resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page">OS Dev website</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</a>
    <ul>
      <li>There is also an online course on <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/operating-systems-virtualization-concurrency-persistence">educative.io</a> that follows this course.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html">Intel’s developer manual</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://os.phil-opp.com">Philipp Oppermann’s blog</a></li>
</ul>
