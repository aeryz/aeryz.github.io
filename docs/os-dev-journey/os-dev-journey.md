# My Operating System Development Journey

I love to learn how things really work and build things from scratch. Since I am interested in virtualization, operating systems and work as an embedded software engineer, I wanted to give this a go. I made some research and prepared a plan for this.

## Gameplan

First of all, O.S. development is a huge task and it won't be like "making a to-do app from scratch". There are many complex and low-level concepts that I need to learn, understand and experiment with. So I created a Trello page to note things that I should learn, or improve my knowledge. 

Secondly, writing about what I learned motivates me and makes it much more easier to things that I have done so far. So I will keep this blog up-to-date as much as possible.

And finally, let's talk about the actual learning part.

At first, I am planning to follow the [phill-opp's os development series](https://os.phil-opp.com). I think this series will give me not in-depth but good understanding of how things work. Since it is practical, and written mostly in Rust, I probably will enjoy this a lot.

Then I think, I will proceed with [this course](https://www.educative.io/courses/operating-systems-virtualization-concurrency-persistence) which follows [this book](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/#book-chapters). While I follow these resources, I am gonna try to implement things by myself and experiment with different things.

And of course, I will read and follow other great resources and documentations as well like the amazing [os-dev website](https://wiki.osdev.org).

Let the journey begin!
