# My Operating System Development Journey

I love to learn how things really work and build things from scratch. Since I am interested in virtualization, operating systems and work as an embedded software engineer, I wanted to give this a go. Here are some good resources:

- [OS Dev website](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page)
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
    - There is also an online course on [educative.io](https://www.educative.io/courses/operating-systems-virtualization-concurrency-persistence) that follows this course.
- [Intel's developer manual](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html)
- [Philipp Oppermann's blog](https://os.phil-opp.com)
